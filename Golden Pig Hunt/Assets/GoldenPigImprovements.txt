app store ready: 
- better control of the fence (it realy sucks)
- 2-3 new pig classes 
- good looking background
- background music... some hillbilly banjo stuff would be nice
- better scoring system, you have to feel better when you collect a golden pig (visual effect f.e.)

Nice to have: 
-? some flying stuff that you have to press before it reachs the fence, otherwise it freezes for a short time
